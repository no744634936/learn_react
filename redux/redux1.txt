
// createStore  from Redux library

    const {createStore}=Redux


// reducer function is where we do the interacting with the store

// when the reducer first interact with the store it's not know the state,
// it is not going to exist,so we have to initialize  the state
// if we want to edit the data in the store we don't edit it directly 
// first we dispatch an action into the reducer.
// reducer take the action and according to the type of action to change the state,

//create an action and pass it to reducer 
//action is a javascript object ,
//it has type property which describe the action.(一般为大写字母)
//and a optional payload of data. we can name it whatever we want 

    const initState={
        todos:[],
        posts:[]
    }

    const todoAction ={
        type:"ADD_TODO",
        todo:"buy milk"

    }

    function myreducer(state=initState,action){
        console.log(state,action)
        
    }

//create a store. store is tightly coupled with a reducer function 
//so the store knows which reducer to interact with.

    const store= createStore(myreducer)


//dispatch an action 
//this means send todoAction to the myreducer function 

   store.dispatch(todoAction)

会看到console 里面有打印两次

第一次,在创建的时候执行。
Object{
    type:"@@redux/INITx.74.53.43"
}
Object{
    posts:[],
    todos:[]
}

第二次，是在 dispatch acition的时候( store.dispatch(todoAction))

Object{
    type:"ADD_TODO",
    todo:"buy milk"
}
Object{
    posts:[],
    todos:[]
}
